        <p>About Pashupati Temple</p>
        <p>
            The temple courtyard has four entrances in the cardinal directions. The western entrance is the main entrance to the temple courtyard and the remaining three entrances are open only during festivals. The temple security (Armed Police Force Nepal) and the Pashupatinath area development trust are selective regarding who is allowed entry into the inner courtyard. Practising Hindus of South Asian diaspora and Buddhists of Nepali and Tibetan diaspora are only allowed into the temple courtyard. Practising Hindus of Western descent are not allowed into the temple complex and must go no further than other non-Hindu visitors. An exception is granted to Sikhs and Jains: if they are of Indian ancestry they may enter the temple complex. Others can look at the main temple from the adjacent side of the river[9] and pay $10 (1,000 Nepali rupees) to visit the small temples located in the external premises of the temple complex.
            The inner temple courtyard remains open from 4 a.m. to 7 p.m. for the devotee, but the inner Pashupatinath Temple is open from 5 a.m. to 12 p.m. for the morning ritual and viewing and from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. for the evening ritual. Unlike many other Shiva temples, devotees are not allowed to enter the inner garbhagriha, but are allowed to watch from the exterior premises of the outer garbhagriha. The temple closing times change depending upon the season: in November, it closes at 6.30 p.m. In summers, it closes at 8 p.m.
